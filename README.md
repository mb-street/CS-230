Project was a software design document for The Gaming Room.  They wanted to design a multiplayer game and needed help deciding on platform and architecture.

I found it very helpful to crystalize and itemize the client's requirements.  It's helpful to reduce bloat and unnecessary tangents.

If I were to revise a piece of this, it might be one of the earlier segments, having learned more about security and distributed systems since then.

Interpreting the user's needs is a process; it works much better as a dialogue guiding an evolving document, otherwise you risk going in the wrong direction.  Needs also might change as the project evolves.

It is helpful to wait on designing the software until all or most of the requirements are solidified.  Then you can identify what patterns or architecture best suits the project in a holistic sense.
